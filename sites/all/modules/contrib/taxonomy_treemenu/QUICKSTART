The module is closely built into Drupal's admin. So close, that in Garland-so-blue-I'm-getting-lost, you may not be able to see where you're going. So here's a quickstart,


Quickstart
-----------
*** The following directions assume you are a top rank Admin. If you are not you will need to be granted appropriate permissions ***


- Install and enable taxonomy-treemenu.
If you have Views enabled, then Taxonomy Treemenu will automatically use that for rendering term lists and nodes.
 - Go to Views and check you have the default templates loaded and enabled. You may need to use tools > 'Views Cache empty', or do a 'cache empty' through the Devel module.
If not, taxonomy Treemenu has it's own internal render functions. No need to do anything.


- If you havn't got one, create a taxonomy and some nodes. If you have a clean installation, the Devel module ('Generate items') can do this quickly.
(Remember - the Forums and Books modules also have usable taxonomies, though I wouldn't tinker with a book - that module has it's own menu system)

- 'Site building > menus'. On that page there is a new link, 'Add taxonomy menutree'. Click on it. 

- Looks like a standard menu creation page page, with some additions. At the top is a new fieldset 'Branch selector'. Drop down the option list and choose a branch to build from - this will be the root of your new menu.
(Note that the root of any menu is not displayed. The base of a treemenu, as displayed to a user, will be the child terms of your chosen root)
Note also the other 'Treemenu render options'. If you are curious, have a look at the options, but don't experiment yet - the defaults have been chosen to yield obvious results.

- Fill in the required fields - 'menu name' and 'title' (same as Drupal core's custom menus). Leave everything else, and press 'save'.

- Type this into your browser address bar,

'mySiteAddress/?q=taxmenu/menu-[nameYouGaveTheMenuInMenuNameField]/page/'

The new menu should appear as page content.

(If you don't recall the 'nameYouGaveTheMenuInMenuNameField',  goto 'admin > menus > nameOfMyMenu' list. The 'nameYouGaveTheMenuInMenuNameField' is listed at the top.)

I think what you see now will probably tell you all you need to know to assess this module.



Fun with options
-----------------
Can you see your menu? Jolly Good! Try this...

- admin > menus > 'nameOfTreemenuICreated'. Click on the 'Edit menu' button.

- Try changing some options.

The options are obvious in their effect. Most of them, anyway. 'link menu roots' is a powerful feature which requires a moment's consideration.

Promote to block
----------------
If you want to try the menu in a block, promote the block called  'nameOfMyMenu-treemenu'. There will be a duplicate block, called 'nameOfMyMenu', but if promoted this will return only a warning message.
