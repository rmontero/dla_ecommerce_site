<h3>Quickstart</h3>
<p>
The module is closely built into Drupal's admin. 
So close, that in Garland-so-blue-I'm-getting-lost, you may not be able to see where you're going. 
So here's a quickstart,
</p>

<h3>Instructions</h3>
<p>
<em>
*** The following directions assume you have menu admin permissions. 
If you are not you will need to be granted appropriate permissions ***
</em>
</p>



<ol>

<li>
<i>Install and enable taxonomy-treemenu.</i>
</li>


If you have Views enabled, then Taxonomy Treemenu will automatically use that for rendering term lists and nodes.
 - Go to Views and check you have the default templates loaded and enabled.
 You may need to use tools > 'Views Cache empty', or do a 'cache empty' through the Devel module.



<li>
<i>If you havn't got one, create a taxonomy and some nodes.</i> 
</li>

If you have a clean installation, the Devel module ('Generate items') can do this quickly.
(Remember - the Forums and Books modules also have usable taxonomies, though I wouldn't tinker with a book - that module has it's own menu system)

<li><i>'Site building > menus'. On that page there is a new link, 'Add taxonomy menutree'. Click on it.</i> </li>


<li>
<i>At the top is a new fieldset 'Branch selector'. 
Drop down the option list and choose a vocabulary or term to build from 
- this will be the root of your new menu.</i>
</li>

The form looks like a standard menu creation page page, with some additions. 

(Note that the root of any menu is not displayed. 
The base of a treemenu, as displayed to a user, will be the child terms of your chosen root)
Note also the other 'Treemenu render options'. 
If you are curious, have a look at the options, 
but don't experiment yet - the defaults have been chosen to yield obvious results.


<li>
<i>Fill in the required fields - 'menu name' and 'title' (same as Drupal core's custom menus). 
Leave everything else, and press 'save'.</i>
</li>



<li>
<i>The message you recieve will have a link to the new menu.</i>
</li>
Or type this into your browser address bar,
'mySiteAddress/?q=tttm/menu-[nameYouGaveTheMenuInMenuNameField]/'


</ol>

<p>
The new menu should appear as page content.

(If you don't recall the 'nameYouGaveTheMenuInMenuNameField',  goto 'admin > menus > nameOfMyMenu' list. 
The 'nameYouGaveTheMenuInMenuNameField' is listed at the top.)
</p>
<p>
I think what you see now will probably tell you all you need to know about what this module tries to do.
</p>


<h3>Fun with options</h3>
Can you see your menu? Jolly Good! Try this...
<ul>
<li><i> admin > menus > 'nameOfTreemenuICreated'. Click on the 'Edit menu' button.</i></li>

<li><i> Try changing some options.</i></li>
</ul>
The options are obvious in their effect. Most of them, anyway. 'link menu roots' is a powerful feature which requires a moment's consideration.

<h3>Promote to block</h3>

If you want to try the menu in a block, promote the block called  'nameOfMyMenu-treemenu'.
There will be a duplicate block, called 'nameOfMyMenu' but, if promoted, this will return only a warning message.
