<h3>Summary</h3>
<ul>
<li>
Paged menus can have a breadcrumb (impossible with non-custom urls).
</li>
<li>
Term pages (lists of node links) can automatically reflect choices of menu structure set in Taxonomy Treemenu 
(this works both for the internal renderer and for the Views module). 
See <a href="&topic:taxonomy_treemenu/term-rendering&">term rendering</a>.
</li>
<li>
Adds template suggestions targeting treemenu items (different prefixes offer different possibilities).

</li>
<li>
...but creates a custom url (prefix with ?q=/ttm/... as default and minimum).
Will potentially double url aliases (unless you only use treemenu URLs for navigation).
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
Consider this, that there is a treemenu on a page.
The links use the Druapl standard routes of 'term/%' and 'node/%'.
A user clicks on a link, and a page of terms (a node list) or the node, is called.
</p>
<p>
Drupal then reacts to the requests. 
'term/%' calls the Taxonomy module, 'node/%' calls the Node module.
The Taxonomy Treemenu module is not called at all, and so can not contribute any data to the page.
This transaction is sometimes reffered to as 'stateless'. 
In summary, one page call can not carry data along to another.
</p>
<p>
Knowledgeable web users will here recognise that, while web communication is generally stateless, computers are not.
Both the server and client computers can carry state information, such as sessions and cookies.
However, for reasons of security and general usage we should not wish to use such methods.
(It may interest you to know that the module DHTML Menu uses cookies to maintain menu state for a user. 
This is an example of a good use of cookies.)
</p>
<p>
Despite the stateless nature of web transactions, 
there is one approved and accepted way of carrying information to a webpage, 
which is to add information to the URL.
Taxonomy Treemenu's solution is to add a prefix to the URL of any node or term called from the menu, 
using link URLs of this form,
</p>
<pre>
ttm/[some information]/node/%
ttm/[some information]/term/%
</pre>
<p>
When a URL such as this is called, Drupal know this is a customized Taxonomy Treemenu link,
so it asks Taxonomy Treemenu how to react and what to put on the page.
At this point the module can add some useful information.
First, on a term page, the module can reorder and filter the node items,
so when a user visits the page, the node list will have the same structure as as the menu.
Second, a paged menu can have a breadcrumb. 
This is because the module can check the node or term value against known links, 
and then work out where in the tree the link must have been.

</p>
<p>
One final advantage gained by prefixes is that they generate useful template suggestions.
All taxonomy treemenu links can be styled with a handful of templates.

</p>

<p>
So far we have discussed gains, but menu prefixes may not be the best solution if you use link aliasing. 
When using a prefix, any node or term will have two valid paths, e.g.
<pre>
node/%
ttm/[some information]/node/%
term/%
ttm/[some information]/term/%
</pre>
<p>
If you use any other navigation method besides Treemenu, you will need two aliases, one for each URL. 
This will be harder to maintain.
Also, the aliases must be different, even if the difference is not very apparent to a user,
e.g.
www.PatricksBlog/BlackWidows
www.PatrickBlog/BlackWidows
 
A search engine will know the difference, so using these options will reduce your page hits.
A developer must weigh up what their site needs, and decide what is best for the site needs.
</p>
<p>
At this point you might like to look at some<a href="&topic:taxonomy_treemenu/site-examples&">examples of site menu configuratiion</a>.
</p>
<p>
One last note, for programmers (of presumably small) sites only.
Drupal hooks will allow Taxonomy Treemenu to affect the rendering of generic links, and they require no state data.
Using hook_link_alter(), for example, 
a coder can call taxonomy_treemenu_get_active_breadcrumbs() and so provide a breadcrumb on paged menus.
</p>
<p>
And hook_preprocess_page() can be used to search for items in a treemenu.
If a page is identified as part of a treemenu, the list of template suggestions can then be altered,
thus styling treemenu targets.
</p>
<p>
Drupal hooks can add these functions without altering the URLs, and so requiring multiple aliases.
But this solution will add considerable weight of code to every link or page call on a site.
Which is why they are not currently implemented in the module
You can always implement them yourself, if you have a special need.
