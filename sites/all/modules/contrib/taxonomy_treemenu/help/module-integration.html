<h3>Site Map, Menu Block, and other modules which offer to display preconstructed menus</h3>
<p>
Taxonomy Treemenu renders it's terms as Drupal links.
Therefore the terms of any menu should render perfectly well in any such module.
Usefulness varies. For example, Sitemap rendering may be useful in the context of a commercial site,
particulary as Taxonomy Treemenu delivers a full menu, not a simple collection of links.
Usage with the likes of Menu Block verges on the insane - but you can try... 
</p>
<p>
The node links on treemenus are delivered by a specialist renderer into the menu cache. 
Therefore, these types of modules can't see them - sorry.
But node rendering is one of the most popular features of the module, 
so this issue will not cause us to drop it. 
</p>
<p>
Aside from some specialised rendering, 
Treemenu offers many of the possibilites of these kinds of modules within it's generalised functionality.
For example a designer can put a menu into a block, page a menu like this ?q=ttm/[menu-name] and so forth.

<h3>Taxonomy Redirect</h3>
<p>
If you want to push term links through to custom items, without the fuss of a template, this does the job very nicely.
</p>
<p>
*** Warning 6x-1.3. It works well when you do it, but you can't go backwards! 
If you try to switch redirects off, you'll find any extended URL menus will keep reverting to stock URLs. 
You'll need SQL I'm afraid, some variant of,
<pre>
UPDATE vocabulary SET module='taxonomy' WHERE name= ?;
</pre>
or I think you can do the same thing through PHPAdmin
***
</p>
<p>
Here's the punchline. 
If you try taking the redirects OFF an extended URL menu, the URLs will revert to stock URLs. 
Unless you do the SQL fix above.

<p>
We claim to be blameless for this...
