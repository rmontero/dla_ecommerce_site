<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>
The administration interface (and the code) sometimes refers to 'branches'.
A 'branch' is any item in the Taxonomy, a Term or Vocabulary.
Taxonomy Treemenu can build a menu from both terms and vocabularies.
For a user, there is no difference.
</p>


<h3>On picking a branch</h3>
<p>
The root of a menu does not show.
</p>
<p>
Here is part of a taxonomy,
</p>
<p>
Now, let's say you want to build a menu based on the term 'cars'.
You pick 'cars' as the root item,
</p>
<p>
The menu grown from cars will look like this,
</p>
<p>
If we showed the root item, the menu would look like this,
</p>
<p>
Which is rather stupid for navigation, as you already wanted cars.
It is inefficient for the user, as they are not offered a choice on the first level.
It is also visually inefficient, as a column of screen space has contains one item only.
</p>
<p>
Another way of looking at this; choose the term or vocabulary which 'contains' the root items you wish to show.
In Taxomomy lingo, that means the <em>parent</em> of the base menu items.
