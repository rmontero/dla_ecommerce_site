<h3>Summary</h3>
<ul>
<li>
An internal theme for term lists.
</li>
<li>
Neutral styling, similar to the Views 'Unformatted' style.
</li>
<li>
Fully templated using functions, so fast but quite easy to customize.
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
A term page theme which is, initially, a list of links wrapped in 'divs'.
Replaces the term theme provided by Druapl.
Similar to the Views 'Unformatted' style, but without the overhead of running Views.
Further styling through templates and css very easy.
</p>
<p>
As with the stock Drupal style, the list is paged.
However, as it is links only, this theme can hold many more items per page than the usual taxonomy term theme.
'Items per page' is controlled by a setting which you can find at 'Administer > Content Management > Post Settings' (?q=admin/content/node-settings).
