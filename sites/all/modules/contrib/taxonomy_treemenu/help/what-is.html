<h3>Taxonomy Treemenu</h3>

<p>

</p>
<p>
<i>a lot of menu</i>
</p>
<p>
Taxonomy Treemenu makes menus out of the Taxonomy. 
</p>

<p>
The links are Drupal links, and the menus are Drupal menus, not custom widgets or styling. 
So you get a recognisable and flexible result, and can start work on your site, not making the module 'fit'.

</p>
<p>
That's it, really. 
If you'd like to try, have a look at the <a href="&topic:taxonomy_treemenu/quickstart&">QUICKSTART</a> and README files, 
which are now duplicated in this help.
</p>

<h3>Installation</h3>

<p>Some modules don't use Drupal's enable/disable, install/uninstall module facilities, because they don't need them.
Taxonomy Treemenu uses them.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
When you disable the module, you remove all menus, but you keep the base data.
</li>
<li>
if you re-enable the module, Taxonomy Treemenu will attempt to re-build menus from any available data.

</li>
<em>WARNING:</em> This could be a very expensive operation!


Imagine you have six general menus with nodes, on a 200 node site. 
That's a lot of work to do at once. 
So consider what you are doing!
</ul>

<h3>Special Requirements</h3>
<p>
Taxonomy Treemenu only uses the resources it needs. 
The base computing requirements are small, and the module should run on most Drupal installations.
</p>

<p>
However, the module has powerful capabilities. 
It is easy to create a menu with thousands of links, and <em>that</em> action may overload your installation.
</p>
<p>
The dependancies for the moudle are a couple of core modules - Taxonomy and Menu.
</p>
<p>
Treemenu can work with other modues. Here are some initial comments,
</p>
<b>DHTML Menu</b>
<p>
DHTML Menu is intended as a self-sufficient module. 
However, for a considerable length of time (-> 6.x-2.2), 
DHTML Menu used a simple internal interface, and Taxonomy Treemenu simply called into it. 
In DHTML Menu 6.x-3.5 the interface changed.
We have some doubts about the new approach, which uses tree recursion,
something we have cut down to a minimum in this module (so it's a shame to see it occuring elsewhere),
and link hooks, which we avoid completely.
</p>
<p>
At the time of writing, Taxonomy Treemenu uses  DHTML Menu 6.x-3.5 only. 
Future interactions between the two modules may be subject to change.
</p>
<b>Views</b>
<p>Taxonomy Treemenu has a measure of Views integration</p>
<p>See the help page <a href="&topic:taxonomy_treemenu/views-integration&">Views Integration</a> for the current state of play. </p>
