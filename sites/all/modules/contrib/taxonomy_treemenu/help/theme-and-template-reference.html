<h4>terms (lists of child nodes of taxonomy terms)</h4>

<i>Stock Drupal styling</i>
i.e. from a URL like taxonomy/term/4

You can change the term description and css by overriding the function
theme_taxonomy_term_page($tids, $result)

You want to change the contents of a row in the display? You are way out of luck.
The rows are rendered using an unthemed function taxonomy_render_nodes($result).

Several options then,

Use the Views module. Put anything in the rows then.
Use a taxonomy field extension module e.g. ?.
(A little like the above), there are Content Construction Kit type modules for terms. I don't know if or how they might work with taxonomy Treemenu. 
Hang on for Drupal 7, scheduled to have field additions to term lists? 

<i>Treemenu unformatted styling</i>
Three overridable theme functions

theme_taxonomy_treemenu_term_unformatted_page($term, $result)
  $term presently has tid, name, and description fields.
theme_taxonomy_treemenu_term_row_data($data)
  $data is the result of a taxonomy treemenu query on nodes. Presently, has sticky, title, and created fields.
theme_taxonomy_treemenu_term_row($row)

All in taxonomy_treemenu/includes/taxonomy_treemenu.pages.inc
