<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>
WARNING: translation is a work in progress. Some of this may reflect intentions, not finished code.
</p>
<h4>Always</h4>
<ul>
<li>
Treemenu will recover whatever term information it can, in whatever langauge. 
So if a term is untranslated, or in another langauge, it will be displayed.
</li>
This is done to preserve the Taxonomy, and consequently the menu, structure. 
Node links, however, will be removed.
</ul>

<h4>Translation using core (Even if the 'Locale' and 'Translate Content' (Translate) modules are enabled)</h4>
<ul>
<li>
Treemenus use the default language. THEY OVERRIDE OTHER SETTINGS IN DRUPAL.
</li>
</ul>


<h4>Translation with the 'Internationalization' module, 
and the i18nmenu and i18ntaxonomy sub-modules, enabled</h4>

<ul>
<li>
i18taxonomy offers various options for translating terms, based in the vocabulary.
See 'admin/content/taxonomy/' (and edit the chosen vocabulary). 
Depending on the term translation mode, Treemenu offers further options for translating menus.
<p>*** WARNING: using multilingual content ('Per language terms'),
your menu many not look as you expected after creating translations. 
A menu rebuild will fix this ***</p>
</li>


<li>
The i18taxonomy option which allows most Treemenu options is to set the 'Translation Mode' to 'Per language terms'.
</li>
</ul>


<h3>Translation in Drupal and Taxonomy Treemenu</h3>

<p>
Drupal uses the core modules 'Translate' 
(shown in the interface as 'Content Translation') and 'Locale'.
The translation facilities in Drupal allow for multi-lingual sites.
That is, not only can Drupal convert the text, but there are facilities for recognising 
which language a site visitor wishes to see, or an administrator wishes to show, and switching the view.
</p>
<p>
However, the facilites are not complete. Drupal 6 can't translate custom menu items or taxonomy terms.
These gaps are covered by a contributed module called 
<a href="http://drupal.org/project/i18n">Internationalization</a>. 
When installed, a user will find that this module is a collection of modules in one download. 
There is much information associated with this module; several further modules, for example,
and good instructions.
If you would like your website to work in several langauages, you should at least have a look, 
even if you find the core Drupal facilites are enough. 
</p>


<p>
At present, Taxonomy Treemenu translation is advanced, but half-developed. 
The following contains information about Taxonomy Treemenu and translation.
To translate content, a designer needs to enable both core modules, then load
<a href="http://drupal.org/project/i18n">Internationalization</a>,
then enable i18nmenu and i18ntaxonomy.
</p>


<h3>If you want to translate, this is useful to know</h3>
<p>
Drupal has layers of data and code to choose langauge,
<p>
<img src="path:images/drupal_translation.png"/>


</p>
All the other options you may stumble across or find, are part of this interaction.
Some more information,
</p>


<ul>
<li>
The base assumptions are used more than you may think. 
This is where Drupal starts when it wishes to find a translated node (politics, eh?)
This is also a factor when another language is used (should untranslated content be displayed or erased?).
</li>
<li>
The default langauge is stored in a variable in the database.
That's what is generally appearing when you see a language code appear at the start of a URL,
though the URL may be modified by the switch block.
<p>
There are several strong warnings against changing this setting. 
The problem seems to be that translated strings depend on this setting and not the no-translation/English base.
Therefore, if you change the setting, Drupal looses all track of current string translations.
</p>
</li>
<li>
The current language is stored in a PHP global variable concerning language.
It's mainly concerned with overriding languages in multi language sites.
It may override other settings, or be overidden itself, when a forceful request is made for a certain language.
</li>
<li>
Most general data is capable of carrying a language (users/nodes etc.). 
This may override other data, or the lack of this data may cause the language to default to something else.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
The settings used to choose these langauges, and the interactions between them, cause complexity...
</p> 




<h3>Provision using core (even if 'Locale' and 'Translate Content' are enabled)</h3>


<p> 
Taxonomy Treemenu should NOT react to the presentation language, or through the 'Language Switcher' block.
</p>
<p>
We do not know about other usages of translations, such as setting by node or URL - 
please post your experiences/ideas to the issue queue. 
</p>


<h3>Translation of Treemenus using 'Internationization', and submodules 'i18nnenu' and 'i18ntaxonomy'</h3>
<p>
*** WARNING: when using multilingual content ('Per language terms') there are many taxonomy changes.
Your treemenu many look strange after adding translations - 
the module compulsively generates links as the taxonomy changes. 
For example, translated material may appear in the menu root. 
A menu rebuild will fix this. ***
Coding note: Yes, sometime I need to look for code hooks and the like to fix this.
</p>
<p>
Treemenu provides options based on the underlying vocabulary status.
</p>
<p>
The easiest way to see this is to go to the treemenu edit form and look at the status display.
</p>
<p>
Since Taxonomy Treemenu builds menus from links to content (terms/nodes), 
the widest range of options is availible if the underlying vocabulary is set to 'Per language terms'.
</p>


<h3>Background to the code</h3>
<p>
All modules have a hard time with translation facilities.
Taxonomy Treemenu has a couple of peculiar problems, because it auto-generates menus from the taxonomy.
</p>

<p>
First, we are displaying terms. But core will not currently translate terms. 
Early on, the module supported node translation, but that makes little sense when the terms can't be translated.
So the module currently overrides the core translations. 
If the <a href="http://drupal.org/project/i18n">Internationalization</a> and i18ntaxonomy sub-module are not enabled,
nodes are displayed consistently, like the terms, in the default language.
</p>

<p>
Second, both the coders and the users have a problem, or an opportunity?
Do you wish to treat term translation as,
<ol>
<li>A translation of the term, rendered into a menu?</li>
(This has the disadvantage, maybe, of not being able to change the language from the web interface.
Treemenu must read the taxonomy again, and rebuild the menu in a new langauge.)

<li>A translation of a string?</li>
(This has the disadvantage of not being usable for structural purposes, 
e.g. you can never search on a translated term string.)

<li>A translation (a full copy) of the term itself</li>
(This is awkward and lengthy to set up and trigger, for coders, users, and administrators.)
</ol>
These options all have their advantages, too; string translation, for example, is very easy to administer.
And then there are further good options offered by the <a href="http://drupal.org/project/i18n">Internationalization</a>
 module's i18ntaxonomy sub-module, such as translating whole vocabularies.
</p>

<p>
Treemenu's author decided to enable a subset of the functionality, because,
<ol>
<li>He was tired.</li>
<li>Several options don't apply to treemenus.</li> 
For example, string localization is mainly intended for custom menu items.
Treemenus deal in linkable content (terms and nodes), so being able to switch the title seems of little advantage.
</ol>
