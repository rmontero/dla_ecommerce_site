<h3>Summary</h3>
<ul>
<li>
Term lists accessed through a treemenu have the same structure as the menu. 
</li>
<li>
Internal or Views rendering also provides fully styled rendering of multiple breadcrumbs.
See <a href="&topic:taxonomy_treemenu/template-suggestions&">template suggestions</a> for more information. 
</li>
<li>
Requires alteration of term URLs.
See <a href="&topic:taxonomy_treemenu/custom-urls&">custom urls</a> for more information.

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>
<b>NOTE FOR VIEWS USERS:</b>
Using this option, page titles are set by Taxonomy Treemenu, not Views! 
Taxonomy Treemenu is asking Views for page content rendering only!
</p>

<p>
On some sites, sidebars and menu boxes (on the front page, for example) are not the primary sorce of navigation.
These sites may use search boxes, or full page lists of terms (or even sortable Views) to help the user navigate.
On these sites the default setup of Taxonomy Treemenu is ok. 
Taxonomy Treemenu is presumably adding some quick anviagation links tojump a user into certain subject areas,
or a sitemap for those users who need an overview.
</p>

<p>
Other sites may be using Taxonomy Treemenu as a primary source of navigation.
The 'node' option may be enabled and Treemenu links take a user straight to content.
On a site such as this, when a user pages a term (list of nodes in a category), 
they would hope to see the list of nodes in the same order as the menu.
</p>

<p>
This is impossible with a standard Drupal setup.
Taxonomy Treemenu has many options for ordering and filtering nodes, so tampers with the default structure of the menu.
And on paging, the Drupal stock URL 'taxonomy/term/%' will list whatever is under the term, 
without allowing Taxonomy Treemenu to structure the node list.
</p>

<p>
However, it can be done. The first requirement is to give Taxonomy Treemenu a say in rendering terms.
This must be done using an altered URL, as Treemenu must know about this early in the rendering process.
See <a href="&topic:taxonomy_treemenu/custom-urls&">custom urls</a> for more information.
The second requirement is that Treemenu is told to change the rendering, and how to go about this. 
This is done by enabling the option, and using eeither the internal renderer or the built-in Views template.
</p>

<p>
Coders will note that that there is another way of altering term lists which does not alter stock Drupal styling. 
This is by use of hook_db_rewrite_sql().
While this approach would seem to offer advantages in some situations, we have not enabled it.
Without targeting URLs, any use of this hook would override every term page on site.
And Taxonomy Treemenu's adaptations are wholesale, not small...
