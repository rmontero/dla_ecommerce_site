Adds TrackBack support to Drupal. Sending and retrieval of TrackBacks are supported either using POST or GET.

About TrackBack:
  "In a nutshell, TrackBack was designed to provide a method of
   notification between websites: it is a method of person A saying to
   person B, "This is something you may be interested in." To do that,
   person A sends a TrackBack ping to person B."
