This is a simple filter module. It converts a Scripture reference into
a clickable link that points to one of several on-line Bibles. The
default is the NIV in English on biblegateway.com's site. It can also
use the ESV online Bible and the NET Bible.

It is an adaptation of a PHP port of the Scripturizer Perl plug-in. A
full list of credits is in the CREDITS file.
