 1. Installation

    * Extract the files to the appropriate location (sites/all/modules) on your web server.
    * Enable the module on the modules page (admin/build/modules)

 2. Configuration

    * Go to the footermap settings page (admin/settings/footermap)

    * Recurse Limit
       * The recurse limit is the menu depth for every menu.
       * By default footermap will crawl through each enabled menu, and display each menu 
         item in the footer.

    * Drupal Root Menu
       * Input which mlid you would like to start grabbing menus from.  This is useful if
         you only want to grab from one unique menu tree other than Primary Links, 
         Secondary Links, or a top custom menu.
       * By default footermap will use your Drupal installation's highest level menu mlid
         (usually 0).

    * Available Menus
       * Check which of the top menu blocks you wish to enable.
       * NOTE: if you do not have any menu items this will be blank.  Create a menu item,
         and then go back to the settings page and click Save Configuration.

    * Enable System Menu Items
       * Toggles between displaying items defined as being part of the 'system' core module. This is bad, but due to a bug in Drupal core is necessary to display views-generated menu items unfortunately.
       * You should only use this option when you have specifically controlled views menu items in certain trees, and not for Navigation menu items.

    * Enable Legacy Footermap
       * Display footermap in hook_footer ($footer_message). This is the old-style of rendering the footermap, and should only be used for those users who do not modify their theme/layout. The new method is to enable footermap via the block admin interface.

    * Enable Caching
       * Toggle cache support. This greatly speeds up your site when footermap is enabled. 

 3. Theming

    * Each primary menu that you enable is rendered in a div tag, and each of the children
      included are passed through Drupal's theme_link function.

    * By default, footermap will use footermap.css. You can add a float attribute to
      the footermap-col class in order to keep everything on one line. This all
      depends on the number of items in your footermap. You may need to play with the
      width tag to get things how you want them.

    * Classes:
       * footermap: in the footermap div wrapper
       * footermap-col: in each primary menu wrapper
          * footermap-col-N
          * footermap-col-MENUNAME
       * footermap-item: in each unordered list tag
       * menu-N: in each unordered list item tag

 4. Troubleshooting

    * White Screen
       * NOTE: This means that there has been a php error. Please consult your apache/iis
         error logs. I cannot help with this issue without error logs.
       * This could be a memory issue.
    * Views
       * You can turn on views menu items with the "Enable System Menu Items" option,
         but this will enable all system menu items. There is no finer grain control than
         this.
